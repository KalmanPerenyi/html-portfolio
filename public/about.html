<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I was born a long time ago in a country far far away - on a gloomy September morning in 1978, in Budapest, Hungary. Not to be mistaken with Bucharest, Hungarians don't like this mistake - probably Romanians would object as well. Also, please never joke with "I'm hungry too", because it is a super lame joke even for the first time, but believe me, we hear it every single time we meet with some comedian from UK or US or Australia.</p>
<p>When I was a kiddo, I wanted to be a diver, an explorer, or an astronaut. Later I wanted to be a security expert, a psychologist, or a physicist. But then I ended up being a computer scientist. Funny twist: When I was 12 years old, I had to write a quiz program in Basic as a special demonstrative project for my class. I loved this project, but little did I know that I'll end up writing programs for living, some decades later!</p>
<p>Unfortunately life took me to another direction. For family reasons I never finished my University, went to Bristol to work in a really awesome pub for a few years, to learn the language properly ("How bist gettn'on?"), then ended up working in a finance department of an SSC back in my hometown for many many years - nearly one and a half decade! I did quite a lot of VBA programming (Excel and Access macros mostly), but only as side projects for most of the time. Only when I switched companies did I get into an actual developer team - to develop in KNIME, a visual data transformation tool.</p>
<p>My heart was always in coding though. So recently I embarked on a new journey, you could say I started to study in my private University on Udemy, and started learning some contemporary, super-exciting skills - Python, Web Development, LLM and AI. It's time I finally learn something I'm really interested in - and then let that guide the next step in my career...</p>
