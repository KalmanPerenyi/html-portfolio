 <h1>The Best Movies according to Kálmán</h1>
 <h2>My top 5 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>1. - Man From Earth</h3>
 <p>Super intelligent movie about a bunch of university professors exploring the possibility of a crazy idea.</p>
 <h3>2. - Midnight Run</h3>
 <p>Super funny and surprisingly warm buddy comedy about a bounty hunter (De Niro) taking a mob accountant back to the bail bond agency, where he will surely meet his early demise - but the trip takes much longer than expected.</p>
 <h3>3. - Jesus Christ Superstar</h3>
 <p>Beautifully made musical with the best rock opera songs of all time.</p>
 <h3>4. - Nimona</h3>
 <p>Incredibly funny, and beautifully made animated move about a shapeshifter befriending a knight in a knightpunk scifi story about discrimination and standing up for what's right.</p>
 <h3>4. - I'm a Cyborg, but that's OK</h3>
 <p>Crazy Korean movie about a bunch of seriously scizophrenic people living in an asylum, who face a brand new challenge when the new joiner looks like she'll die of starvation because she cannot eat human food - as she's convinced she's a cyborg.</p>
